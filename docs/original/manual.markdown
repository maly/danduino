# 1. Operating System

DAN64 boots into a shell that reports the operating system version (v1) and
the amount of RAM available for user programs:

    DAN64 v1, 58880 bytes free
	Ready

The prompt line is identified by a blinking square cursor.

The command interface supports backspace and the left and right cursor arrows
for editing input. The screen automatically scrolls when reaching the bottom
of the screen.

## 1.1. Shell Commands

The shell commands are case insensitive. Addresses are expected in hexadecimal
format (`xxxx`, example: 1a00).

Any input that doesn't match one of the supported commands will result in a
`ERR: CMD` error.

### 1.1.1. help

The `help` command will print the list of currently supported commands:

      LOAD, SAVE [addr [addr]], RUN
	  LIST [addr], AS [addr]
	  PEEK [addr], POKE [addr],
	  CLS, HELP

### 1.1.2. cls

The `cls` command will clear the screen positioning the cursor at the left top
corner of the screen.

### 1.1.3. load

The `load` command is used to load programs into DAN64. The programs are loaded
starting at the `0x1a00` address, just after video memory.

An external audio device able to play audio files (programs) is required. Connect
a 3.5mm audio cable from the audio output of your media device into DAN64 audio
in jack.

The operating system will ask for confirmation by pressing the enter key, or
cancellation by pressing ESC key:

    Press <ENTER> when ready,
	<ESC> to cancel...

Once enter is pressed, the audio file should be played in the external device.
The playback volume has to be set to the right levels for DAN64. Start with a
90% and adjust from there. Check the load error codes for help.

DAN64 screen will be switched off during the loading process.

When the program has been successfully loaded, the program size will be
displayed:

    402 bytes
	Ready

#### Load Errors

##### ERR: TIME

The loading process timed out. This may happen when the audio playback doesn't
start soon enough after enter key has been pressed.

You may need to adjust the output volume of your media device.

##### ERR: IO 01

The magic number in the audio file was incorrect. This happens when the audio file
is not a DAN64 program.

You may need to adjust the output volume of your media device.

##### ERR: IO [02, 03, 04, 05]

You may need to adjust the output volume of your media device.

##### ERR: IO 06

The parity byte on the data block was incorrect. This may happen when the audio
playback doesn't have enough quality.

### 1.1.4. save

The `save` command is used to save programs from DAN64 into external storage.

Two optional parameters are supported: *start address* and *end address*. By
default start address is `1a00` and the end address is `ffff`.

For example, to save the first 512 bytes of user program:

    save 1a00 1b00

An external audio device able to record audio files (programs) is required. Connect
a 3.5mm audio cable from the audio out jack of DAN64 into the audio input of your
media device.

The operating system will ask for confirmation by pressing the enter key, or
cancellation by pressing ESC key:

    Press <ENTER> when ready,
	<ESC> to cancel...

Start recording in your media device and then press enter. When the program has
been successfully saved, the program size will be displayed:

    512 bytes
	Ready

DAN64 screen will be switched off during the saving process.

### 1.1.5. run

The `run` command is used to run current program starting at `0x1a00` memory
address.

Depending on the program, it may not exit back to the operating system, but if
it does, the result can be:

 - **Ok**: the program finished with no error (code 0).
 - **ERR: PRG xx**: the program finished with error code `xx` (hexadecimal number).
 - **ERR: SYS xx**: the program generated an unsupported SYS call `xx` (hexadecimal number). 

The programs are not checked for validity before running.

### 1.1.6. peek

The `peek` command is used to display memory contents, in both its hexadecimal
representation and in printable characters, 48 bytes at a time.

One optional *address* parameter is supported. By default `peek` will start from
address `0000` and increment by 48 bytes the last address (unless a new address is provided).

Example:

	peek 1b00
	 1b00: 48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 Hello 
	 1b06: 77 6f 72 6c 64 21 world!
	 1b0c: 00 de 10 44 ff ff ...D..
	 1b12: ff ff 2c 21 ca 09 ..,!..
	 1b18: cc 8b 0e 44 21 83 ...D!.
	 1b1e: 04 08 52 13 a1 bf ..R...
	 1b24: 2f 00 00 00 00 a0 /.....
	 1b2a: 04 08 22 86 04 08 .."...

### 1.1.6. poke

The `poke` command is used to set memory contents, one byte at a time. Press enter
without providing a value in order to cancel the operation.

One optional *address* parameter is supported. By default `poke` will start from
address `0000` and increment by one byte last address (unless a new address is provided).

### 1.1.7. list

The `list` command is used to disassemble memory contents.

One optional *address* parameter is supported. By default `list` will start from
address `1a00` and increment by 12 instructions the last address (unless a new address
is provided).

Example:

	list
	 1a00:  a9ff     LDA #$ff
	 1a02:  8500     STA $00
	 1a04:  a9ff     LDA #$ff
	 1a06:  8501     STA $01
	 1a08:  20181a   JSR $1a18
	 1a0b:  20241a   JSR $1a24
	 1a0e:  48       PHA
	 1a0f:  20541a   JSR $1a54
	 1a12:  a900     LDA #$00
	 1a14:  02       SYS
	 1a15:  4c151a   JMP $1a15
	 1a18:  a000     LDY #$00


See [1.2. DAN64 Integrated Assembler and Disassembler] for further details.

### 1.1.8. as

The `as` command is used to assemble instructions into memory.

One optional *address* parameter is supported. By default `as` will start from
address `1a00` and increment by 1 instructions the last address (unless a new address
is provided).

See [1.2. DAN64 Integrated Assembler and Disassembler] for further details.

### 1.2. DAN64 Integrated Assembler and Disassembler

DAN64 includes an integrated assembler and disassembler for the 6502 CPU.

The assembler is exposed through the `as` shell command (see: [1.1.8. as]) and
the disassembler is used by the `list` shell command (see: [1.1.7. list]).

The memory layout of the 6502 CPU is as follows:

	0x0000 - 0x00ff : zero page
	0x0100 - 0x01ff : stack
	0x0200 - 0x1aff : video memory
	0x1a00 - 0xffff : user program

The assembler supports all 6502 instructions plus the custom **SYS** instruction used by
the API (see: [2. DAN64 API]).

Supported instructions are: ADC, AND, ASL, BCC, BCS, BEQ, BIT, BMI, BNE, BPL,
BRK, BVC, BVS, CLC, CLD, CLI, CLV, CMP, CPX, CPY, DEC, DEX, DEY, EOR, INC, INX,
INY, JMP, JSR, LDA, LDX, LDY, LSR, NOP, ORA, PHA, PHP, PLA, PLP, ROL, ROR, RTI,
RTS, SBC, SEC, SED, SEI, STA, STX, STY, SYS, TAX, TAY, TSX, TXA, TXS and TYA.

See \hyperref[tab:addrmodes]{supported addressing modes} for an overview of the
supported addressing modes.

Mode					Format
---------           	-------
Immediate				#nn
Absolute				nnnn
Zero page				nn
Implied
Indirect absolute		(nnnn)
Absolute indexed X		nnnn,x
Absolute indexed Y		nnnn,y
Zero page indexed X		nn,x
Zero page indexed Y		nn,y
Indexed indirect		(nn,x)
Indirect indexed		(nn),y
Relative				nnnn
Accumulator				a
---------           	-------

: Supported addressing modes \label{tab:addrmodes}

By default the numbers are expected to be decimal and hexadecimal numbers can be
specified using the `$` prefix. For example:

	as 1a00
	 1a00: lda #$ff
	Ok

An special input mode is provided to make easier to enter arbitrary data by using the
`.` (dot) command, followed by a quoted string, a decimal or hexadecimal number (using
the `$` prefix) or the `,` (comma) as separator.

Example (string, end of line and end of string):

	as 1b00
	 1b00: ."Hello world", $0a, 0
	Ok

Any problem parsing input will be reported with an `ERR: SYNTAX` error.

# 2. DAN64 API

The 6502 virtual machine implements an extra instruction **SYS** (opcode `0x02`) that
allows user programs to access DAN64 services.

Current supported services are:

 * 0x00: Terminate program
 * 0x01: Load data
 * 0x02: Save data
 * 0x10: Put character
 * 0x11: Put string
 * 0x12: Set cursor position
 * 0x13: Fill screen
 * 0x14: Write (used by CC65 C compiler, supports stdout and stderr only)
 * 0x20: Get character
 * 0x21: Get input
 * 0x22: Read (used by CC65 C compiler, supports stdin only)
 * 0x30: Put tile
 * 0xa0: Get random
 * 0xa1: Wait for vsync
 * 0xa2: Set random seed
 * 0xf0: Get version

The service is specified in the accumulator and the parameters (if any) are pushed into
the stack before running the `SYS` instruction (in reverse order).

Example (terminate program, exit code 0):

	lda #$00
	pha				; exit code 0
	sys				; A already contains the service number (00: terminate program)

The `SYS` instruction is not equivalent to a function call, and only the accumulator
and the `pc` registers will be altered. This means that the caller will have to
remove the parameters from the stack after a `SYS` call.

Example (put a character restoring the stack):

	tsx				; save the stack pinter
	lda #64			; '@'
	pha
	lda #$10		; put character
	sys
	txs				; restore the stack
